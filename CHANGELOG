version 0.3.0 - released 2005-10-25

        * added patch by Ralf Fischer <me@makii.de> to enable the user
          to specify the geometry on the command line (width of the machine
          list, width of the summary area, width of the terminal area).

        * updated omnitty man page to reflect aforementioned changes

version 0.2.9 - released 2005-07-10

        * added support (via ncurses' define_key()) for alternate escape
          sequences for function keys. Should improve compatibility
          with several X terminal emulators.

        * added support for machine renaming (patch contributed by
          Richard Palmer <richard.palmer@gmail.com>)

version 0.2.8 - released 2004-10-15

        * added -W option to allow user to specify list window width.
        * added copyright notices to files
        * 'make install' now honors the DESTDIR environment variable if set,
          so as to make it easier to install the program on a 'fake root'.
          Mainly for building distro packages, but has other uses.

CHANGELOG starts at version 0.2.7
